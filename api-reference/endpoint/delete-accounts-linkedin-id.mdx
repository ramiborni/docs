## Deletion Effects

When you delete an account:

1. The LinkedIn session is terminated
2. All associated message history is removed
3. All campaign data for this account is deleted
4. The account cannot be recovered
5. An `account.deleted` webhook event is sent

## Implementation Example

```javascript
const axios = require('axios');

async function removeLinkedInAccount(id) {
  const url = `https://integration-api-gateway.agreeablesea-e4815929.swedencentral.azurecontainerapps.io/api/linkedin/accounts/linkedin/${id}`;

  try {
    const response = await axios.delete(url, {
      headers: {
        'X-API-KEY': process.env.SENDPILOT_API_KEY
      }
    });

    if (response.data.action === 'linkedin_account_deleted') {
      console.log('Account deleted:', response.data.linkedinAccountId);
      return { success: true, accountId: response.data.linkedinAccountId };
    } else {
      console.log('Account not found');
      return { success: false, reason: 'not_found' };
    }
  } catch (error) {
    throw error;
  }
}

// Safe deletion with confirmation
async function safeDeleteAccount(id, confirmed = false) {
  if (!confirmed) {
    throw new Error('Deletion not confirmed. This action is irreversible.');
  }
  
  // Pause any active campaigns first
  await pauseCampaignsForAccount(id);
  
  // Delete the account
  return await removeLinkedInAccount(id);
}
```
