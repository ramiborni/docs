description: "Queue a LinkedIn connection request through a managed account in the SendPilot pool"
---

Send a LinkedIn connection request to a target candidate. The request is queued and processed asynchronously by SendPilot's managed account infrastructure.

## Request Body

<ParamField body="leadUrl" type="string" required>
  Public LinkedIn profile URL for the target lead.
  
  Example: `https://www.linkedin.com/in/alex-example/`
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="providerId" type="string" required>
  Identifier of the connected LinkedIn provider returned by the connect-account flow.
  
  Example: `prov_li_acc_001`
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="connectionNote" type="string">
  Optional invitation message to deliver with the request. Premium accounts can send up to 300 characters; standard accounts should stay under 200.
</ParamField>

## Response

<ResponseField name="action" type="string">
  Outcome of the submission. Returns `connection_sent` when the connection request is handed off for delivery.
</ResponseField>

## Example Request

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.sendpilot.example.com/connection-request \
  -H "X-API-KEY: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "leadUrl": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/alex-example/",
    "providerId": "prov_li_acc_001",
    "connectionNote": "Hi Alex, I'd love to connect and share more about our open role."
  }'
```

## Example Response

```json
{
  "action": "connection_sent"
}
```

## Best Practices

<Tip>
  **Personalize messages**: Connection requests with personalized messages have higher acceptance rates.
</Tip>

- Keep notes under 200 characters unless you are certain the provider has premium messaging limits (max 300)
- Confirm the `providerId` corresponds to a connected LinkedIn account before sending batches
- Validate LinkedIn URLs prior to submission to avoid malformed request errors
- Retry on transient infrastructure errors (503/504) with exponential backoff
