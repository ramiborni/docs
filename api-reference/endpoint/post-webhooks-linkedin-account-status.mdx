</Info>

## Proposed Webhook Event

<ParamField body="eventId" type="string" required>
  Unique identifier for this webhook delivery. Use for idempotency protection.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="eventType" type="string" required>
  Always `account.status_changed` for this webhook.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="timestamp" type="string" required>
  ISO-8601 timestamp when SendPilot detected the account state change.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="accountId" type="string" required>
  Unique identifier for the SendPilot-managed account.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="status" type="string" required>
  Current account state. Values: `ACTIVE`, `DISCONNECTED`, `DELETED`.
</ParamField>

## Proposed Webhook Payload Example

```json
{
  "eventId": "evt_01j0status123",
  "eventType": "account.status_changed",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-05T10:00:00Z",
  "accountId": "acc_sendpilot_001",
  "status": "DISCONNECTED"
}
```

## Handling the Webhook

1. **Verify signatures** using the `X-SendPilot-Signature` header, identical to other SendPilot webhooks.
2. **Check idempotency** with `eventId` (or your preferred unique key) before persisting the update.
3. **Update internal records** so downstream systems see the new account status.
4. **Trigger remediation flows** when `status` indicates the account requires attention.

<Warning>
Respond with `200 OK` once the event is accepted for processing. Return `5xx` only when you require SendPilot to retry delivery.
</Warning>
