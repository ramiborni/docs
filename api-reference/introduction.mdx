## Authentication

All API requests require authentication using API key headers. Include the following headers in every request:

```bash
x-user-id: YOUR_USER_ID
x-project-id: YOUR_PROJECT_ID
x-environment: production  # or "sandbox"
```

### Example Request

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.sendpilot.example.com/messaging/message \
  -H "x-user-id: YOUR_USER_ID" \
  -H "x-project-id: YOUR_PROJECT_ID" \
  -H "x-environment: production" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "linkedinAccountId": "clxxx123456",
    "leadUrl": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-doe",
    "text": "Hi John, I wanted to reach out about an opportunity."
  }'
```

### Clerk Authentication (Alternative)

Some endpoints also support Clerk authentication using a Bearer token:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_CLERK_TOKEN
```

<Warning>
Keep your authentication credentials secret. Never commit them to version control or expose them in client-side code.
</Warning>

## Environments

SendPilot supports two environments:

| Environment | Description | Header Value |
|------------|-------------|--------------|
| Sandbox | Testing and development | `x-environment: sandbox` |
| Production | Live production traffic | `x-environment: production` |

Use the `x-environment` header to specify which environment you're targeting.

## Error Handling

The API uses standard HTTP status codes and returns structured error responses:

```json
{
  "error": "Invalid request data",
  "message": "linkedinAccountId is required"
}
```

Common status codes:
- `200`: Success
- `201`: Created (message sent)
- `202`: Accepted (async processing)
- `400`: Bad request (invalid payload)
- `401`: Unauthorized (invalid credentials)
- `404`: Not found
- `429`: Rate limit exceeded
- `500`: Internal server error

## Rate Limits

API rate limits vary by endpoint and environment:

- **Sandbox**: More permissive limits for testing
- **Production**: Stricter limits to protect account health

Monitor your rate limits using the [Account Status endpoint](/api-reference/endpoint/get-account-status).

## Webhooks

SendPilot can send real-time notifications to your webhook endpoints for:

- **Message Received**: When a LinkedIn message arrives
- **Connection Accepted**: When a connection request is accepted
- **Account Disconnected**: When an account loses connectivity

Register webhooks using the [Webhook Registration endpoint](/api-reference/endpoint/post-webhooks-register) or configure them in your SendPilot dashboard.

## Getting Started

1. **Obtain credentials**: Get your `x-user-id`, `x-project-id` from SendPilot
2. **Connect a LinkedIn account**: Use the [Connect LinkedIn endpoint](/api-reference/endpoint/post-account-connect-linkedin)
3. **Send your first message**: Try the [Send Message endpoint](/api-reference/endpoint/post-message)
4. **Set up webhooks**: Register webhooks to receive real-time notifications

## SDK & Libraries

Official SDKs coming soon. For now, use standard HTTP clients:

```javascript
// Node.js example
const sendMessage = async (linkedinAccountId, leadUrl, text) => {
  const response = await fetch('https://api.sendpilot.example.com/messaging/message', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'x-user-id': process.env.SENDPILOT_USER_ID,
      'x-project-id': process.env.SENDPILOT_PROJECT_ID,
      'x-environment': 'production',
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({ linkedinAccountId, leadUrl, text })
  });
  
  return response.json();
};
```
